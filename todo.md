Critical

- [ ] possibleDiscreteDomains for numerics.

- [ ] Use Weka *.arff data.
- [x] Visualize trees.
    - [ ] Use GUI.
- [ ] Add documentation.

Improvements

- [x] Use iterative learning. See **General Criteria on Building Decision Trees for Data Classification (2.1)**: Empirical evidence suggests that a correct decision tree is usually found more quickly by this iterative.
method than by forming a tree directly from entire training sets.
